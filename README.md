# Pebble
> A free funky formalicious icon set for React (& plain ol' SVG & PNG)

Pebble has been sitting on my shelf for a very long time. There's no real demographic or target use case for this set:   
it's mainly intended as a counterpart to all the clean, geometric sets out there. Sometimes, your design could use a little fun(k): that's where Pebble comes in.

## How to use Pebble
Pebble is offered as plain SVG, PNG, or as React components (built with [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/)). Either clone the repo, or install it with Yarn: 

```
yarn add pebble-icons
```

or NPM: 

```
npm install pebble-icons
```

For the React components, you can add the `color` prop to set your own fill: there's no stroke in any of them.

## Questions / requests?
Just leave an issue on this repo. However, Pebble is just a little thing I did on the side so I'm not making any promises :)
